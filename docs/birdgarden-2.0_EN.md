**Birdgarden 2.0** is an educational initiative that merges a passion for nature — particularly birdlife — with the potential of technology, the ethos of open source, and a commitment to scientific outreach. Born out of the desire to promote urban ecology through accessible tools, the project seeks to bring citizens, students, and no profit associations closer to environmental monitoring via a technological device that is both simple and powerful.

At the heart of the initiative is the creation of birdhouses or feeders — even 3D-printed if preferred — equipped with a camera and embedded sensors. These components are discreetly integrated into the structure and serve to collect environmental data, images, and video, documenting birds activity in a non-invasive way. The gathered content, following an approval process, may be published on a dedicated portal (https://www.webradiofaro.it/birdgarden/), promoting community participation and public awareness. To ensure complete energy autonomy, the birdhouses are powered by solar panels coupled with a power bank, making installation feasible even in remote natural areas or urban locations without access to the electrical grid.

The foundation of Birdgarden 2.0 lies in the desire to combine a love for nature, DIY craftsmanship, and programming with a collaborative educational approach. The data generated by Birdgarden installations can serve as an informational basis for naturalistic studies and multidisciplinary learning activities. In this sense, the project also functions as a tool for designing educational pathways that foster open source culture and STEM competencies within middle and high schools, engaging students aged 13 to 19.

The initiative embodies a spirit of public engagement and community participation, serving as a self-financing model for the leading organization, Il faro d’argento APS (https://www.webradiofaro.it). Birdhouses may be built independently or purchased through outlets such as the LIPU (https://www.lipu.it), strengthening the network of awareness surrounding urban biodiversity and helping gather donations to support related efforts.

From a technological perspective, the system integrates a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a camera module, accompanied by a Micro:bit microcontroller, and an ultrasonic sensor for detecting bird presence. The entire software ecosystem is developed in-house by project members and released as open source (https://github.com/idamato/birdgarden), offering the public free access to code, documentation, and assembly instructions. This open framework has enabled the activation of free workshops, such as those hosted by the Roma/Infernetto@SecondoSabato/ILFARO club through the CoderDojo network (https://codeclub.org).

Birdgarden 2.0 is supported by a group of environmentally minded technology enthusiasts collaborating with schools, local entities, and third-sector organizations. The project has been publicly showcased in various events, including Maker Faire 2024/2025 in Rome (https://makerfairerome.eu), the Code Club Conference 2025 in Cambridge and Villaggio per la Terra (https://villaggioperlaterra.it) in Rome, engaging numerous participants and fostering an active community. Two editions of the STEM course have been held at I.C. Aristide Leonori (https://icleonori.edu.it) in Rome, targeting lower secondary students and culminating in the installation of a device.

Future developments include new functionalities designed in cooperation with the Italian Amateur Radio Association – Ostia Section (https://www.ariostia.it). Among these is the exploration of image transmission via FM SSTV radio technologies — the same used aboard the International Space Station — as well as low-power communication methods using Mesh networks and the LoRa protocol, allowing deployment in remote areas without Wi-Fi coverage.

Internal working groups are also investigating the use of artificial intelligence for automatic bird species recognition through audio and image analysis. This broadens the educational scope to include AI-related themes while enabling even more detailed biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the project is well-suited to integration within Citizen Science initiatives, encouraging active public participation in image classification and validation of data produced by intelligent modules.

On the outreach front, Il faro d’argento APS is developing plug-and-play kits suitable for users with limited technical skills, thus expanding opportunities for public involvement. A dedicated school module has also been created to guide students and teachers through every project phase — from concept to programming, installation, and monitoring.

Numerous events, technical workshops, and training sessions — both online and in person — have helped disseminate the project to an increasingly broad audience. Although primarily focused on birds, Birdgarden 2.0 also considers extending monitoring to other small animals, thus expanding its ecological reach.

In a broader context, the initiative is aligned with themes of environmental sustainability and social impact. It encourages the use of birdhouses within urban reforestation and community gardening projects and is often accompanied by the creation of urban vegetable plots.

Ultimately, Birdgarden 2.0 aims to serve as an active element in Smart City development plans, contributing to the creation of more livable urban spaces that are mindful of biodiversity. In summary, what began as an educational and experimental initiative aspires to become a participatory environmental monitoring network capable of generating valuable scientific data, promoting technical and ecological knowledge, and inspiring citizens to care for and connect with urban ecosystems.
