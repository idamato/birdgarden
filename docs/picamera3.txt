The maximum resolution of the sensor is 4608×2592 pixels, therefore note that it has a 16:9 rather than a 4:3 aspect ratio. Because of the special nature of this
sensor, the HDR feature is not available at the maximum resolution, but only at a resolution of 2304×1296 pixels.

--------- example ----------
from datetime import datetime
from picamera2 import Picamera2
from gpiozero import LED
import time

# If a LED light is used as flash during night photos/videos
flash_led = LED(17)
cam = Picamera2()
config = cam.create_still_configuration(...parameters...)
cam.configure(config)
cam.start()
flash_led.on()
# Let the light sensor adapt to the LED for 1 sec.
time.sleep(1)
cam.capture_file('filename.jpg')
flash_led.off()
cam.stop()
----------------------------

To show exposition information put those lines after the sleep 1 sec.
md = cam.capture_metadata()
print(f"Analogue Gain: {md['AnalogueGain']}",
f"ExposureTime: {md['ExposureTime']}",
f"ColourGains: {md['ColourGains']}")

t='{:%Y%m%d-%H%M%S}'.format(datetime.now())
filename = 'snap'+t+'.jpg'

cam.start_and_capture_file(f"static/{filename}",
show_preview=False)
# Copy it to the latest.jpg file
shutil.copyfile(f"static/{filename}", 'static/latest.jpg')
